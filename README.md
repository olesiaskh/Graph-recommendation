# Graph-recommendation
Restaurant recommendation system based on a bipartite graph (link prediction).

## What is this about?
This project is a restaurant recommendation system based on a bipartite graph that uses information about previous restaurant visits by a set of people, alongside their reviews. It was originally developed using a NYC restaurant check-ins dataset from Forsquare (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danofer/foursquare-nyc-rest).

The approach is as follows: build a bipartite graph matching users to venues they have visited and enjoyed (based on the reviews), use the graph and visit information to build a feature vector for each user-restaurant match (restaurant sentiment, average number of visit to venue, graph similarity metrcs like Jaccard index, etc.), and then use the vectors to train a binary classificatiob model to predict link (1) vs no link (0).

## What is included?
The repository includes all necessary source code (data preprocessing and graph construction, sentiment and similarity calculations, model training, feature importance analysis), as well as a report describing the approach and results in detail.
